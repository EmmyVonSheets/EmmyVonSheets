<h1>Hi, I'm Emmy!<br/><a href="https://github.com/joshmadakor1">Data Analyst</a> and <a href="">Aspiring Cyber Security Professional</a></h1>

👋 Hello! I'm Emely Ortiz, a passionate data analyst with a keen eye for cleaning and managing large datasets. Over the past year, I've been honing my skills in R, SQL, and Python, using them to find creative solutions and draw valuable insights from complex data.

📈 I am currently building an impressive collection of projects to showcase in my portfolio, demonstrating my expertise in data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving. From data cleaning to impactful visualizations, I enjoy every step of the data analytics journey.

🎓 Beyond data analytics, I'm pursuing certifications in Cyber Security at WGU, striving to broaden my knowledge and make a positive impact in the world of information security.

💻 When I'm not diving into data or studying, you can find me playing video games and streaming on Twitch or unleashing my creativity by drawing on my iPad.

🌟 Join me on my data-driven adventures as I explore new opportunities and continually expand my skills in the world of data analytics and Cyber Security.
